This report is submitted for completion of the Summer Webdev class conducted by IET, NITK Surathkal.
I'd like to thank the mentors for their continued enthusiasm and support throughout this course. The assignments were interesting, and the last assignment took the cake. I could rely on the mentors for their help through and through, for which I am thankful. I learnt about HTML, css, bootstrap, nodejs, and Mongodb. The resources given were concise and useful. This entire program has made me capable to undertake larger projects, and I am confident I can tackle complicated tasks.
To all the mentors I've annoyed, I'm sorry, and thanks for sticking with me. You guys have been great. 
Thank you.
